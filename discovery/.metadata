	This sample demonstrates how to use the built-in SSDP support 
	to implement a remote viewer. Remote viewer applications on 
	the same network are discovered and share an avatar photo and 
	message. Each client displays the avatars discovered using a 
	bounce-style animation implemented by a behavior. You can 
	change the photo and message shared by remote viewer applications 
	to make each avatar unique. This example is useful for learning 
	how to build a client/server discovery application, detect devices 
	added and removed, implementing a custom animation and invoke 
	requests to remote application servers.
