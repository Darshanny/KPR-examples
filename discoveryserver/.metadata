	This server app is intended to be run simultaneously with the "Device Discovery Client" example and demonstrates how to implement a discoverable device. The app/device is made discoverable by setting the "shared" application property to true. The "color" handler is called remotely by the client and returns a JSON object containing a CSS color string.
